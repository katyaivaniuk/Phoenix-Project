# Phoenix Ukraine 

## Overview
Since Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, and a full-scale war started in 2022, Ukrainian cities experienced tremendous destruction and displacement, leading to significant challenges in infrastructure, housing, and essential services. The ongoing conflict has resulted in the devastation of key facilities, including schools, hospitals, and transportation networks, which are critical for the daily lives of citizens. In this context, the Phoenix Ukraine project is an initiative focused on developing a website to support and manage the reconstruction of transportation networks during and in the aftermath of the war. Due to the scope and the timeline of the project, I will be focusing on developing a website to support the reconstruction of the bridges in various regions of Ukraine. 
Phoenix Ukraine is an initiative aimed at assisting in the reconstruction of transportation networks, particularly bridges, in Ukraine. This project provides a platform to gather data on the destruction of specific structures and prioritize reconstruction efforts within regions to aid decision-making.

## Features
- **Project Prioritization**: Utilizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) algorithm to prioritize bridge reconstruction based on multiple criteria such as area of damage, reconstruction costs, and traffic volume.
- **News Updates**: Stay informed with the latest news related to the reconstruction efforts and the overall situation in Ukraine.
- **Interactive Map**: Visualize the status and reconstruction needs of various bridges.


## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Data Visualization**: Leaflet.js
- **Algorithm**: Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
